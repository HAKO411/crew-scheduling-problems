# Crew scheduling problems, models, and methodologies for bus drivers

## Abstract
This paper aims to explore various crew scheduling problems, models, and method- ologies. It provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of crew scheduling approaches over time, including the introduction of different approaches and their recent advancements. Additionally, the paper presents a column generation approach based experiment which address the bus driver (Crew) scheduling problem using a dataset comprising fictitious information on 50 daily bus trips. The experiment employs two optimization models to optimize the function, tracking the total time spent driving, including the current shift of the driver. Implementing these models can contribute to ensuring driversâ€™ well-being, safety and providing high-quality transportation services to passengers.
